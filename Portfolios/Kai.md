## Week 1 (1/31 - 2/7)
During our January 31st meeting, our group brainstormed and discussed various methods for computing the [Convex Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) for a set of 2d vectors. We discovered methods for computing the convex hull that fall under two general categories: angles-based and distance-based. My contribution was an angles-based one similar in format to the [Gift Wrapping Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm), though with the help of my group members and mentors we managed to approach the [Quickhull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickhull) algorithm, which is significantly more clever and has cheap `O(n log(n))` time complexity. This week I aim to complete an implementation of both the 2d and 3d quickhull algorithms, with my developing an understanding of Python's graphics libraries an ancillary objective.
