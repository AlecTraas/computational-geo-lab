# UVA Geometry Lab Spring 2024: Computational Geometry

## Weekly Meetings

We will be meeting 5PM - 6:30PM in Chemistry 202, the Maker Open Lab.

## Portfolios

Each week, we ask that you update your portfolio with a new entry. Here are some prompts to help get you started:

Summarizing

* What topics did you learn about this week, either in the Wednesday meeting or in preparing for next week's meeting? Try to pick out one and explain it as if you were teaching someone about it.
* What did you work on in your group meeting?

Reflecting

* Are there any topics that were particularly interesting to you this week? Any that were confusing or challenging?
* How did studying material and working on your own go?
* How did your group meeting go? Do you feel like you made progress? Was there somewhere you all got stuck?

Planning

* Do you have questions for the upcoming meeting? Anything you want to present to everyone else?
* What do you plan to work on this coming week?
* Do you think you're going to make changes to how you work? (whether on your own, how group meetings run, etc.)

If you have questions for the mentors, don't hesitate to email us!
